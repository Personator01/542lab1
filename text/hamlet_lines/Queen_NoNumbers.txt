 Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you, 
 And sure I am two men there are not living 
 To whom he more adheres. If it will please you 
 To show us so much gentry and good-will 
 As to expend your time with us awhile, 
 For the supply and profit of our hope, 
 Your visitation shall receive such thanks 
 As fits a king's remembrance.
 Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz: 
 And I beseech you instantly to visit 
 My too-much-changed son.--Go, some of you, 
 And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
 Ay, amen!
